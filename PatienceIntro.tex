We know how important action is, but acting rashly, without care and attention can do serious harm to ourselves and can undo the good progress we've made towards our aims.

Patience can look like a lack of engagement or a lack of committment but there's often more harm done through an emotional (over) reaction (cf. \ref{MA_GRIEF}) and certainly we're only likely to waste time if we act angrily.

As much as we are expected to play the game with limited information we should take time to reflect and consider what we do know before committing to a course if action. We also need to be open to changing our plans as more facts are revealed. 

At all times we need to maintain a level of control so that we can act correctly, we don't fly into a rage, we don't make snap judgements and we don't let ourselves be carried away by the crowd.
