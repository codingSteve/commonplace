We know how important action is, but acting rashly, without care and attention can do serious harm to ourselves and can undo the good progress we've made towards our aims.

Patience can look like a lack of engagement or a lack of committment but there's often more harm done through an emotional reaction (cf. \ref{MA_GRIEF}) 

At all times we need to maintain a level of control so that we can act correctly, we don't fly into a rage, we don't make snap judgements and we don't let ourselves be carried away by the crowd.
