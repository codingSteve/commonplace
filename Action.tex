Without physical action our plans for improvement simply won't get very far. We need to look at the mamoth task un front of us and take that scary first step (and then the next). 
Taking action isn't always easy and choosing the right move (cf. \ref{JVG_ACT}) at the right time  
(cf. \ref{ST_WAIT}) is stupefyingly hard. 
The hope is though that we won't be paralysed and we will make an impact on the things important to us
