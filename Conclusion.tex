Time is desperately short, so taking the time to work on this project, to make this journey, must be important. Thinking about these qualities and how they relate to each other and our lives must have an important impact on our lives. 

But the notes here are not important, they won't stop tragedies, they won't make us perfect parents, partners or friends, they certainly can't make the sun shine when we're at the beach. The words here are just pointers and references to what we should be aiming at. The notes here are just words, just ideas, but without giving them agency in the real world, without using them to shape our actions and responses we have no way to help ourselves and those around us. 

Without daily practice of the qualities we've covered here the notes here are truly are wasted they truly are nothing.
