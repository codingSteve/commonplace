Without action of some kind our plans for improvement simply won't get very far. We need to look at the mamoth task in front of us and take that scary first step (and then the next). 
Taking action isn't always easy and choosing the right move (cf. \ref{JVG_ACT}) at the right time (cf. \ref{ST_WAIT}) can be stupefyingly hard.
The hope is though that we won't be paralysed and we will make an impact on the things important to us.

We won't be successful all the time (in particular I'm not even be successful much of the time) but by persevering (cf. \ref{AR_HABIT} and \ref{JP_STAND}) we can chip away at the habits (and even relationships (cf. \ref{LC_COMPANY})) that are slowing us down or even undoing good progress we've already made.

We need to remember what's important to us. Remember how much time we have and how we choose to spend it. Marcus often looks at how little life he's been allotted (and how much he thinks he has left) and it's a good reminder for people like us to just get on with it.

We also need to remember that people will see where we spend our time and the choices made. No matter what we say they will believe what they see (and don't see).
