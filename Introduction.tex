We all want to be better people, shout at the kids less often, get some perspective at work and call our friends and family more. We have a picture of a better version of ourselves but we're still fallible, lazy, tired and busy. Best intentions fall away and we forget our better selves. 
To make our jobs a little easier we can listen to Marcus Aurelius who tells us that without a goal we can't live consistently (cf. \ref{MA_GOAL}). Thinking about the sort of qualities we want to show is a great first step but we need a little more help. 
To get us through the tough spots We're going to get help from philosophers, sportsmen, fictional characters, artists and people smarter than us.
