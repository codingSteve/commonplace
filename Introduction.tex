We all want to be better people, shout at the kids less often, get some perspective at work and call our friends and family more. We have a picture of a better version of ourselves but we're still fallible, lazy, tired and busy. Best intentions fall away and we forget our better selves. 
To make our jobs a little easier we can listen to Marcus Aurelius who tells us that without a goal we can't live consistently (cf. \ref{MA_GOAL}). Thinking about the sort of qualities we want to show is a great first step but we need a little more help. 
To get us through the tough spots We're going to get help from philosophers, deities, sportsmen, fictional characters, artists and other people smarter than us. 

The hope here is that we can turn to our "manual" for help at times when previous generations may have turned to their religious text of choice for solace or guidance. 

The set of qualities we're looking to develop here are inspired in part by the Modern Virues page from the School of Life (\llink{http://bit.ly/1XoP0tE}), the majority of content is helpful quotes and aphorisms. Anything useful you find in these pages will be directly attributable to them.
