The notes here are not important, they won't stop tragedies, they won't make us perfect parents, partners or friends. The notes here are just words, just ideas, which you might find useful but without action and focus and patience and generosity we have no way to put them to use. We have no way to help ourselves and those around us. Without daily practice of the qualities we've covered here the notes here are truly are wasted they truly are nothing.
