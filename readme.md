Pointers
========

A collection of quotes and aphorisms to keep close at hand. The PDF is setup to have the same dimensions as a Penguin Pocket Classic. These dimensions, as well as everything else, have been created by others smarter than me and attributed as well as I can.

Sample of books used as sources for the pointers included:

- Meditations: A new translation (Gregory Hayes) - Marcus Aurelius - Modern Library
- Twelve Caesars -  Suetonius - Penguin Classics
- Walden - Henry David Thoreau - Penguin Classics
- Lectures and Sayings (Cynthia King) - Musonius Rufus - William B. Irvine
- The Talmud - Norman Solomon - Penguin Classics
- Enchiridion - Epictetus - Dover thrift editions
- Counsels and Maxims - Arthur Schopenhauer - Start Publishing

The intention here is only that readers will find something useful.
